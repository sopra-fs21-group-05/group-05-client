# SoPra FS21 - Pictures Client 

## Introduction
Pictures is a quick-playing family game with very simple rules.
Form the image on your secret picture card with one set of components,
either shoelaces, color cubes, icon cards, sticks and stones or building blocks
in such a way that the other players guess what image you have pictured.

The implementation was done as a part of the 'SoPra' course at the University of Zurich.

## Technologies
-   React JS - User interface
-   npm - Package management
-   Heroku - Deployment
-   SonarQube - Code Quality Control

## High-level Components


## Launch & Development

For your local development environment you'll need Node.js >= 8.10. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org). All other dependencies including React get installed with:

### `npm install`

This has to be done before starting the application for the first time (only once).

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console (use Google Chrome!).

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

> For macOS user running into an 'fsevents' error: https://github.com/jest-community/vscode-jest/issues/423

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
